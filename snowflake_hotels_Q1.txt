What are all real estate properties in EMEA from this commercial database? The output of the code should return 6 columns 
    property_building_key

    city_name
    year_property_built

Step 1: find the key for the EMEA global region. Use the table Global Region and search by global_region_desc. 
        Search by EMEA capital letters. There are multiple EMEA regions in Global Region, and to find the active key you must 
        search for global_region_code that begins with 'E-GRGN'
