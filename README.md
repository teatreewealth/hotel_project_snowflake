# hotel_project_snowflake
This project explores full service hotel properties across some European regions. The aim is to create a Snowflake database with the tables in the snowflake_hotels_tables file and leverage the data to extract some statistical information about the hotel properties. 

The data explorer will be able to answer questions such as: 
What are all real estate properties in EMEA from this commercial database?
How many properties in EMEA are Full Service Hotels?  
What are the top 10 cities by number of full service hotels in Continental Europe and the UK?
What are the Spanish and Portuguese cities with more than 5 full service hotels?

The 4 tables in this database are: dim_property_building, dim_country, dim_global_region, dim_property_usage
