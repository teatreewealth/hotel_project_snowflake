Exercise 2
What are the Full Service Hotels properties in EMEA? The output query must return the following 5 columns:
    property_key
    property_name
    country_name
    property_type
    property_subtype

It must be sorted by country_name in ascending order. Save the output as EMEA_full_service_hotels. 
*/

/*
Step 1
You must first find the keys for property type Hotel and property subtype Full Service Hotel. 
Filter property_usage table by type and subtype to find the corresponding keys for Hotel type and Full Service Hotel subtype. 
Use the property_usage_type_desc and property_usage_sub_type_desc to search key words "hotel" and "full service hotel" all lowercase. 
To return a unique combination of property type and subtype make sure to use DISTINCT in the select statement otherwise the output will return duplicates.

Step 2: With the global_region_key found at step 1, search for all commercial properties located in EMEA. 
You will have to join property_building, global_region and country tables to find the answers and return the desired output.
