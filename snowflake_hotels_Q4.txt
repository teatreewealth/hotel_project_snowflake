Question #4
What are the top 5 cities in Iberia (Spain and Portugal) by number of full-service hotels? Calculate the total number of full service hotels by country and city and display the output with the following columns:
    city_name
    country_name
    num_of_full_service_hotels 

Sort the results by number of full service hotels in descending order.
